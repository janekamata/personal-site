# Intro

Hello, I'm passionate about analytics storytelling and empowering others to transform data into meaningful visual insights. In my spare time, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of creativity and data. Feel free to check out my [Tableau Public portfolio](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jane.kamata/vizzes) portfolio to see my work.

In 2024, I won Tableau's Iron Viz: Student Edition for my data visualization about [Japanese animation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jane.kamata/viz/StudioGhibliGlobalForceinAnimationIronVizStudentEdition2024/StudioGhibli). Since then, I've been a two-time [Tableau Ambassador](https://www.tableau.com/community/community-leaders/ambassadors), seven-time Vizzie Award nominee, and two-time Viz of the Day creator.

Currently, I'm completing my undergraduate studies at Northeastern University, where I'm studying Computer Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Business Analytics. While at Northeastern, I've completed two co-ops at [Bain Capital](https://www.baincapital.com/), creating data-driven insights for private market investments and real estate. In summer 2025, I will be interning at [Forvis Mazars](https://www.forvismazars.us/) on their Analytics consulting team.  




# Some History

  

- In ninth grade, I had my first introduction to data visualization and Tableau from my school's [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/frc/) team. We used Tableau to analyze data about competitors' robots during competitions.

- In my second semester of college, I was reintroduced to Tableau through Northeastern University's *Information Visualization for Business* course, where I learned more about the theory behind visualizing data and really leveled up my visualizations.

- In my third semester of college, I became a teaching assistant for the same *Information Visualization* course. Since then, I have been a teaching assistant for the course three more times. 

- In spring 2025, after my fourth semester of college, I attended Tableau Conference for winning [Iron Viz: Student Edition](https://www.tableau.com/academic/student-Iron-Viz) 2024. This was my first introduction into the larger DataFam community.

- In fall 2024, I became a Tableau Ambassador and started my journey into becoming an active member of the DataFam. Since then, I've spoken at user groups, presented to students, created technical resources, and received numerous accolades for my work.
